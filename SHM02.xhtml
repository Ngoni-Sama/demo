    <h3>1.2.11 Example: Spring-mass system</h3>
    <p> <br />
      A mass suspended from a spring, displaced vertically and released to move
      freely to produce up and down motion </p>

    <p>The model view of a mass suspended from a spring, displaced vertically
      and released to move freely to produce up and down motion with right panel
      showing the displacement, velocity and acceleration.  </p>

    <h2> Q1: under what conditions would this vertical spring mass system’s
      motion be not well modeled as a simple harmonic motion?</h2>
    <p><br />
      H1: the model assumes the restoring force by the spring is F = -ky, it is
      always correct for any magnitude of oscillation y in real springs. Is it
      always valid in the real spring motion when the spring is hyper extending
      beyond the linear limits of Hooke's Law ?</p>
    <h2>Q2: change the simulation y=0 m and Play the model. In the your model Y
      = _________, suggest your own suitable model that can describe the motion
      y.</h2>
    <h2>Q3: in this same motion, propose the velocity and acceleration model(s)</h2>
    <h2>Q4: carry out some other conditions, verify that the general equations
      for displacments if can be model by Y = Y<sub>0</sub>sin(ωt+φ)+Y<sub>shift</sub>
      where the usual symbols have the usual meaning. Hence or otherwise,
      Suggest with reasons, the meaning of Y<sub>0</sub> , ω , φ , and Y<sub>shift</sub>.</h2>
    <h2>Q5: similarly, suggest whether the model(s) for velocity, v<sub>Y</sub>
      =ωY<sub>0</sub>cos(ωt+φ) and </h2>
    <h2>a<sub>Y</sub> = - ω<sup>2</sup>Y<sub>0</sub>sin(ωt+φ). Test them out
      using an example of your choice. </h2>
